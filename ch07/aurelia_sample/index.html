    Look for main.js file in the src directory as the initial starting point
    for the application. There does not appear to be any obvious links in the
    main.ts file to the app.ts file, or the App class. It appears that Aurelia
    uses this standard naming convention as a way of finding and bootstrapping
    the Aurelia environment.
