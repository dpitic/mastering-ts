<!-- 
  Aurelia views
  =============
  Aurelia uses a naming convention to tie clases to their views. The class
  is named App, and therefore the Aurelia runtime will search the same
  directory as the class to find a HTML template with the same name. It will
  tie app.ts to app.html and use app.html as a template.

  This file lives in the src directory of the Aurelia application.

<template>
  <h1>${message}</h1>
  <ul>
    <!-- Loop through the items property of the App class. -->
    <li repeat.for="item of items"
      click.delegate="onItemClicked(item)">
      <button>${item.displayName}</button>
    </li>
  </ul>
</template>
